            <p class="pf-project-description">In this project, I developed my first Android app using Android Studio. The Program Reviewer app allows users to review various programs by selecting options via text fields, radial buttons, dropdown menus, and a horizontal scroll view. The app features a homepage with a navigation button to the main screen, which also contains buttons for various program reviews. It was built with a focus on user-friendly navigation and layout design.</p>

            <h3 class="pf-reflection-header">Reflection:</h3>
            <p class="pf-reflection">Developing this Program Reviewer app was an exciting challenge that helped me understand Android development in greater depth. I learned how to work with various UI elements like text fields, buttons, and dropdown menus, and how to create a responsive layout using Android Studio. The most challenging part was ensuring the smooth navigation between screens, especially with the scroll view and button interactions. This app was a great way to build on my previous experience, and I enjoyed refining the user interface design to make it more interactive and functional.</p>
