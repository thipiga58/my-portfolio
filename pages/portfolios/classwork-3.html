            <p class="pf-reflection">Setting up the Flutter environment and working on this app was an interesting experience. It helped me understand the basics of Flutter development, and I encountered challenges like setting up the Android SDK, which I eventually solved. Compared to Classwork 1, I found the coding-focused approach in this assignment more complex, but it provided a deeper understanding of app development. I enjoyed designing the layout with code, though it was a bit more time-consuming than using a graphical interface like in pf 1.</p>
